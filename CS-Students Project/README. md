Computer Science Students Analysis Project
Overview
This Python project analyzes a dataset of computer science students to uncover key academic and career-related trends. Using Pandas for data manipulation, it provides insights into student demographics, academic performance, skill distribution, and career aspirations.

Key Features
Data Preparation
Cleans and restructures raw student data

Handles missing/numeric data conversion

Renames columns for clarity

Resets index after data filtering

Statistical Analysis
Calculates total student count and unique majors

Computes average age and GPA statistics

Identifies highest/lowest GPAs in the cohort

Counts students interested in Data Science

Tracks students with strong Python skills

Advanced Insights
Groups students by future career aspirations

Analyzes average GPA by career path

Examines gender distribution across the program

Technical Implementation
python
# Key Operations
df["Age"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Age"], errors="coerce")  # Numeric conversion
data_science_students = df[df["Interested_Domain"] == "Data Science"].shape[0]  # Domain filtering
avg_gpa_by_career = df.groupby("Future_Career")["GPA"].mean()  # Career-based GPA analysis
Potential Applications
Academic program assessment

Career counseling resource

Curriculum development insights

Student skill gap analysis


Tools Used: Python, Pandas
Data Fields: Student_ID, Name, Gender, Age, GPA, Major, Interested_Domain, Projects, Future_Career, Python/SQL/Java skills
