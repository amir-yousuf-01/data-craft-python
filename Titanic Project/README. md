Titanic Survival Analysis Report
A Data-Driven Exploration of Passenger Survival Patterns
Executive Summary
This analytical report examines the famous Titanic passenger dataset to uncover key factors influencing survival rates during the 1912 maritime disaster. Using Python's data science stack (pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib), we process raw passenger data, perform statistical analysis, and derive meaningful insights about survival probabilities based on demographics and socio-economic status.

Key Findings
1. Overall Survival Rate
38.4% of passengers survived the disaster

Survival rates varied dramatically based on gender, class, and age

2. Gender Disparity in Survival
Female passengers: 74.2% survival rate

Male passengers: 18.9% survival rate

Reflects the "women and children first" evacuation protocol

3. Passenger Class Impact
1st Class: 62.9% survived

2nd Class: 47.3% survived

3rd Class: 24.2% survived

Higher classes had priority access to lifeboats

4. Age Distribution Insights
Majority of passengers were young adults (20-40 years old)

Children (<10 years) showed higher survival rates (not quantified in this analysis)

Methodology
Data Preparation
Handled missing values:

Age: Imputed with median

Embarked: Filled with most frequent value

Removed:

Cabin column (excessive missing data)

Duplicate records

Statistical Analysis
Calculated mean survival rates by gender and class

Generated distribution statistics for age

Performed group-wise comparisons

Technical Implementation
python
# Key Analysis Snippets
survival_by_gender = df.groupby('Sex')['Survived'].mean()
survival_by_class = df.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].mean()
age_distribution = df['Age'].describe()
Conclusion & Insights
The analysis reveals significant disparities in survival rates:

Gender was the strongest predictor of survival

Higher socio-economic status (1st Class) dramatically improved chances

Age played a role, particularly for children

These findings align with historical accounts of the disaster, quantifying the evacuation priorities and privileges that shaped survival outcomes.

1. Survival Rate by Gender :

"This bar chart illustrates the stark disparity in survival rates between male (18.9%) and female (74.2%) passengers,
quantifying the 'women and children first' protocol. The 3.9x higher survival rate for women reflects historical evacuation priorities."

2. Survival Rate by Passenger Class
*"A clear class-based hierarchy emerges in this visualization, with 1st-class passengers surviving at 62.9% - nearly triple the rate of 3rd-class (24.2%).
The graded pattern underscores how socioeconomic status influenced lifeboat access."*

3. Passenger Age Distribution
*"This histogram reveals a right-skewed age distribution, with most passengers aged 20-40. The KDE curve highlights the concentration of young adults onboard,
providing demographic context for survival analysis across age groups."*
